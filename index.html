            <p>Hi there, my name is Connor James Simpson, my RMIT student number is; s3965238. I come from a middling family, both mum and dad have worked in a variety of jobs, and I went to a public school. Made friends and lost friends and eventually found who my real mates were through trial and error! Education wise I have completed year 12 and done a Certificate II in Information and Technology. On top of that, if you can believe it, I am a college drop-out! My home language is English, though my folks, my sister and I all speak a little bit of everything, some days we will greet each other in a mix of English, German and French or ask for something in any number of other languages that we have investigated and studied enough to have some basic understanding of, what can I say, we all enjoy languages though we were all born in Australia. When it comes to down time, I enjoy gaming, whether its video games or tabletop RPG’s so long as I get to chat with some mates and celebrate good wins, I am a happy Chappy! </p>

            <p>Hi! I usually go by ‘Dom’, student number S3961464, I’m naturally hard-working and outgoing with a positive outlook. I can quickly build meaningful relationships and I gravitate towards people who are self-motivated. Should issues unfortunately arise, I believe in fully understanding the view of all involved by discussing them openly and honestly. I also believe that there is always a reasonable solution that can suit all parties in such instances. I enjoy walking in woodland with my wife and dogs, watching a variety of sports and movies, particularly fantasy or sci-fi, reading fantasy books and trying to keep up with current affairs. I am currently studying toward a Bachelor of Commerce in my spare time, being one year into the six-year, part time degree, I have a long way to go but am enjoying the learning experience. My wife and I are also excitedly expecting our first child on the break of the coming new year, so we are spending lots of time planning for them!</p>

            <p>My name is Jared I am an aspiring IT (Information Technology) student of RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). I am starting my journey again into the world of education after the 2 years of break from the schooling system to set myself up for the future ahead (as well as the hindrance of covid). I moved away from my hometown after graduating year 12 to re-evaluate myself and what I wanted to do for the future. Using the extra free time, I had I began to pick up hobbies and interests I was not able to do from my old home. I went out to buy my first skateboard being unsure if I was going to be interested and invested enough to learn. The first few days were like learning to walk again with my balance completely off for every new movement I tried. Although I still feel like a novice to the sport and have much to learn, it has become the most peaceful, calming, and fun activities that I am dedicated to mastering. Skateboarding allowed me to strengthen my physical abilities, clear my mind when needed, as well as understanding how to express myself internally and externally. Using my love for skateboard art and the board itself to express myself within the sport by using the skills I had learned and the art I use to convey my love for the sport and emotions. </p>

                    <div id="profile-analysis">
                        <p>As our team has completed a wide range of personality tests, this analysis will focus on the Myers-Briggs test results for each individual member.  Within the Myer’s Briggs test there are four foundational personality groups: Analysts, Diplomats, Sentinels, and Explorers (Reference 16 personalities). As a team, the Awesome Breakfast Club is quite diverse, covering three of the four personality groups with Trent in the Explorer group, Connor and Jared as Diplomats, and Dominic and Annesha in the Sentinels group. </p>
                        <p>This diversity in personality types means that as a group we have a variation of different attitudes, opinions and perspectives. In terms of communication, we have 60% Introverts and 40% Extroverts. With this mixture of introverts and extroverts, we will need to consciously make our meetings a safe space in which both introverts and extroverts have the space and time to express their thoughts with the group, so they do not go unheard. In practice this can mean proactively running our meeting with an agenda so that all members can come to the meeting prepared for discussion, and then within the meetings, ensuring that every member has a chance to voice their thoughts on the agenda items prior to proceeding with the next topics. As the team contains introverts, it’s important that we utilise these methodologies in practice encourage equal expression and involvement. </p>
                        <p>Within the Myer-Briggs test results, the third and fourth letters letter of a personality type indicate a person’s decision-making techniques and their perception of their surroundings. In analysing the personality types, both traits combined provide insight as to how individuals view and react to conflict. Of the four possible combinations for these pairs, the ABC team has three of the four combinations. The majority of the team have the traits Feeling and Judging (Annesha, Dominic and Jared), whilst Connor is Feeling and Perceiving, and Trent is Thinking and Perceiving.</p>
                        <p>To summarise the different traits, Annesha, Dominic and Jared are likely to have conflict arise when their core beliefs are challenged, and will approach it in an extraverted way, discussing and resolving the conflict verbally. As a Feeling and Perceiving type, Connor is likely to face conflict for the same reasons, however, is more likely to feel this conflict internally. Whist Trent is also likely to experience conflict internally, this conflict alternatively arises when trust and credibility are challenged. In practice, the group can attempt to reduce conflict by being aware of the potential triggers for each member. For the FJ and FP types, one of the most important values is maintaining positive relationships and making sure all members feel heard. For the TP members of the group, it is important that trust is maintained and everyone’s credibility within the group is respected. By respecting each member’s values, the team will be able to uphold a strong level of productivity, reducing conflict and unease withing the team.  In respecting each other’s values, beliefs and integrity, the team also creates a safe environment which encourages both creativity and cohesion. (References to be included)</p>

                <h2>IT Work</h2> 
                <p>Chris Scott, Systems Administrator of a local high school, was kind enough to agree to an interview with me. Unfortunately, due to him contracting covid and having a sore throat he wasn’t able to conduct the interview over video, so we conversed via email instead.  </p>  
                <p>I was meeting with Chris to find out about his experience as an IT professional and hoped to get a deeper understanding of the field, along with any insights he had to be successful within it. I first sought to find out how long Chris had been working as an IT professional. He noted that he had been working full-time for approximately 10 years but had been working part-time for businesses during his final 3 years of high school. Intrigued as to what types of work would be compatible with school hours I posed the question, ‘What kind of work were you doing toward the end of high school? Was it a substantial amount of work?’. Chris answered, ‘Towards the end of school, I was doing quite a few shop fit outs for franchises that were opening stores and then provided them with ongoing support.’ </p> 
                <p>Having established a base for Chris’ experience working as a professional, I wanted to understand how he broke into the field. He surprised me by saying that initially he was totally self-taught and just following his passion for the field. He applied for holiday work at his school which led to full-time job following his completion of high school. Once he was comfortable in his position, he enrolled in a Bachelor of Science (Cyber Security), studying online so he could continue his full-time employment. Although Chris had already gained full-time employment in his chosen field, he still says that ‘If I was to do it again, I’d start university right away’, with the key takeaways from his study being communication and time management skills ‘aside from the actual course content’. So, we had covered the experience and qualifications and now it was into the nitty gritty. Chris told me that his day-to-day job lists included ‘patching software and systems, backup management, log reviewing, application deployment, network changes, network monitoring and end-user support’ with occasional work ‘developing project proposals and deployment of new systems and technology throughout the College’. Most of Chris’ time, however, is spent on ‘Research and documentation’ as well as ‘reviewing the latest patches or software, testing and then deploying’.     
                </p>
                <p>On a weekly basis, Chris doesn’t have significant communication with other IT professionals, in fact the majority of his regular contacts are ‘end-users, management, the helpdesk, and vendors’. He mentioned that he is part of an online group for IT professionals within the local school system, however it does not prompt regular discussion and Chris reflected on the matter stating, ‘I don’t know if this is a school IT issue, a location issue or something of the wider IT profession’.</p>
                <p>I asked Chris if he was spending an increasing amount of time working remotely due to advances in the field, but he says that, although he can perform some aspects of the job from home and this allows him to focus efforts without distraction, most of his working time is spent in the office because ‘for some things, it is easier to be in the office’. </p>
                <p>For the final part of our interview, I gathered some great insights into the challenges and rewards of the professional IT world. Chris told me that other than budget approval, the greatest difficulty he faces in his position is ‘Keeping up to date with the latest technology trends’. Chris says his primary sources for overcoming this are ‘vendors or value-added resellers (vars)’. Chris also says that research is vital whether it be via online blog or conferences which are held consistently. This need for education and research backs up Chris’ personal insight into the IT industry, ‘You can’t stagnate and stop learning otherwise you’ll be left behind’. </p>
                <p>To highlight the rewards and great benefits of the IT industry, Chris shared with me a project that he had developed which captured the essence of the industry as a whole. ‘I digitized our purchase order books into an automated system that gets approval from multiple people. It saves multiple peoples time, leaves an audit trail and stops us buying paper purchase order books’. Innovative developments like this offer economic and environmentally friendly solutions to old and laborious problems, that when implemented across businesses can have an enormous impact on our lives. So, with our interview concluded I am going to wrap it up and take Chris’ sound advice ‘Always have tested offline backups’! </p>
