            <p>Hi there, my name is Connor James Simpson, my RMIT student number is; s3965238. I come from a middling family, both mum and dad have worked in a variety of jobs, and I went to a public school. Made friends and lost friends and eventually found who my real mates were through trial and error! Education wise I have completed year 12 and done a Certificate II in Information and Technology. On top of that, if you can believe it, I am a college drop-out! My home language is English, though my folks, my sister and I all speak a little bit of everything, some days we will greet each other in a mix of English, German and French or ask for something in any number of other languages that we have investigated and studied enough to have some basic understanding of, what can I say, we all enjoy languages though we were all born in Australia. When it comes to down time, I enjoy gaming, whether its video games or tabletop RPG’s so long as I get to chat with some mates and celebrate good wins, I am a happy Chappy! </p>

            <p>Hi! I usually go by ‘Dom’, student number S3961464, I’m naturally hard-working and outgoing with a positive outlook. I can quickly build meaningful relationships and I gravitate towards people who are self-motivated. Should issues unfortunately arise, I believe in fully understanding the view of all involved by discussing them openly and honestly. I also believe that there is always a reasonable solution that can suit all parties in such instances. I enjoy walking in woodland with my wife and dogs, watching a variety of sports and movies, particularly fantasy or sci-fi, reading fantasy books and trying to keep up with current affairs. I am currently studying toward a Bachelor of Commerce in my spare time, being one year into the six-year, part time degree, I have a long way to go but am enjoying the learning experience. My wife and I are also excitedly expecting our first child on the break of the coming new year, so we are spending lots of time planning for them!</p>

            <p>My name is Jared I am an aspiring IT (Information Technology) student of RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). I am starting my journey again into the world of education after the 2 years of break from the schooling system to set myself up for the future ahead (as well as the hindrance of covid). I moved away from my hometown after graduating year 12 to re-evaluate myself and what I wanted to do for the future. Using the extra free time, I had I began to pick up hobbies and interests I was not able to do from my old home. I went out to buy my first skateboard being unsure if I was going to be interested and invested enough to learn. The first few days were like learning to walk again with my balance completely off for every new movement I tried. Although I still feel like a novice to the sport and have much to learn, it has become the most peaceful, calming, and fun activities that I am dedicated to mastering. Skateboarding allowed me to strengthen my physical abilities, clear my mind when needed, as well as understanding how to express myself internally and externally. Using my love for skateboard art and the board itself to express myself within the sport by using the skills I had learned and the art I use to convey my love for the sport and emotions. </p>

                    <div id="profile-analysis">
                        <p>As our team has completed a wide range of personality tests, this analysis will focus on the Myers-Briggs test results for each individual member.  Within the Myer’s Briggs test there are four foundational personality groups: Analysts, Diplomats, Sentinels, and Explorers (Reference 16 personalities). As a team, the Awesome Breakfast Club is quite diverse, covering three of the four personality groups with Trent in the Explorer group, Connor and Jared as Diplomats, and Dominic and Annesha in the Sentinels group. </p>
                        <p>This diversity in personality types means that as a group we have a variation of different attitudes, opinions and perspectives. In terms of communication, we have 60% Introverts and 40% Extroverts. With this mixture of introverts and extroverts, we will need to consciously make our meetings a safe space in which both introverts and extroverts have the space and time to express their thoughts with the group, so they do not go unheard. In practice this can mean proactively running our meeting with an agenda so that all members can come to the meeting prepared for discussion, and then within the meetings, ensuring that every member has a chance to voice their thoughts on the agenda items prior to proceeding with the next topics. As the team contains introverts, it’s important that we utilise these methodologies in practice encourage equal expression and involvement. </p>
                        <p>Within the Myer-Briggs test results, the third and fourth letters letter of a personality type indicate a person’s decision-making techniques and their perception of their surroundings. In analysing the personality types, both traits combined provide insight as to how individuals view and react to conflict. Of the four possible combinations for these pairs, the ABC team has three of the four combinations. The majority of the team have the traits Feeling and Judging (Annesha, Dominic and Jared), whilst Connor is Feeling and Perceiving, and Trent is Thinking and Perceiving.</p>
                        <p>To summarise the different traits, Annesha, Dominic and Jared are likely to have conflict arise when their core beliefs are challenged, and will approach it in an extraverted way, discussing and resolving the conflict verbally. As a Feeling and Perceiving type, Connor is likely to face conflict for the same reasons, however, is more likely to feel this conflict internally. Whist Trent is also likely to experience conflict internally, this conflict alternatively arises when trust and credibility are challenged. In practice, the group can attempt to reduce conflict by being aware of the potential triggers for each member. For the FJ and FP types, one of the most important values is maintaining positive relationships and making sure all members feel heard. For the TP members of the group, it is important that trust is maintained and everyone’s credibility within the group is respected. By respecting each member’s values, the team will be able to uphold a strong level of productivity, reducing conflict and unease withing the team.  In respecting each other’s values, beliefs and integrity, the team also creates a safe environment which encourages both creativity and cohesion. (References to be included)</p>

                <h2>IT Work</h2> 
                <p>Chris Scott, Systems Administrator of a local high school, was kind enough to agree to an interview with me. Unfortunately, due to him contracting covid and having a sore throat he wasn’t able to conduct the interview over video, so we conversed via email instead.  </p>  
                <p>I was meeting with Chris to find out about his experience as an IT professional and hoped to get a deeper understanding of the field, along with any insights he had to be successful within it. I first sought to find out how long Chris had been working as an IT professional. He noted that he had been working full-time for approximately 10 years but had been working part-time for businesses during his final 3 years of high school. Intrigued as to what types of work would be compatible with school hours I posed the question, ‘What kind of work were you doing toward the end of high school? Was it a substantial amount of work?’. Chris answered, ‘Towards the end of school, I was doing quite a few shop fit outs for franchises that were opening stores and then provided them with ongoing support.’ </p> 
                <p>Having established a base for Chris’ experience working as a professional, I wanted to understand how he broke into the field. He surprised me by saying that initially he was totally self-taught and just following his passion for the field. He applied for holiday work at his school which led to full-time job following his completion of high school. Once he was comfortable in his position, he enrolled in a Bachelor of Science (Cyber Security), studying online so he could continue his full-time employment. Although Chris had already gained full-time employment in his chosen field, he still says that ‘If I was to do it again, I’d start university right away’, with the key takeaways from his study being communication and time management skills ‘aside from the actual course content’. So, we had covered the experience and qualifications and now it was into the nitty gritty. Chris told me that his day-to-day job lists included ‘patching software and systems, backup management, log reviewing, application deployment, network changes, network monitoring and end-user support’ with occasional work ‘developing project proposals and deployment of new systems and technology throughout the College’. Most of Chris’ time, however, is spent on ‘Research and documentation’ as well as ‘reviewing the latest patches or software, testing and then deploying’.     
                </p>
                <p>On a weekly basis, Chris doesn’t have significant communication with other IT professionals, in fact the majority of his regular contacts are ‘end-users, management, the helpdesk, and vendors’. He mentioned that he is part of an online group for IT professionals within the local school system, however it does not prompt regular discussion and Chris reflected on the matter stating, ‘I don’t know if this is a school IT issue, a location issue or something of the wider IT profession’.</p>
                <p>I asked Chris if he was spending an increasing amount of time working remotely due to advances in the field, but he says that, although he can perform some aspects of the job from home and this allows him to focus efforts without distraction, most of his working time is spent in the office because ‘for some things, it is easier to be in the office’. </p>
                <p>For the final part of our interview, I gathered some great insights into the challenges and rewards of the professional IT world. Chris told me that other than budget approval, the greatest difficulty he faces in his position is ‘Keeping up to date with the latest technology trends’. Chris says his primary sources for overcoming this are ‘vendors or value-added resellers (vars)’. Chris also says that research is vital whether it be via online blog or conferences which are held consistently. This need for education and research backs up Chris’ personal insight into the IT industry, ‘You can’t stagnate and stop learning otherwise you’ll be left behind’. </p>
                <p>To highlight the rewards and great benefits of the IT industry, Chris shared with me a project that he had developed which captured the essence of the industry as a whole. ‘I digitized our purchase order books into an automated system that gets approval from multiple people. It saves multiple peoples time, leaves an audit trail and stops us buying paper purchase order books’. Innovative developments like this offer economic and environmentally friendly solutions to old and laborious problems, that when implemented across businesses can have an enormous impact on our lives. So, with our interview concluded I am going to wrap it up and take Chris’ sound advice ‘Always have tested offline backups’! </p>

                    <p>The first prototypes of autonomous driving systems were unveiled in the early 1920’s but were closer to remote controlled than autonomous. (Kroger, 2016). In recent years, catalyzed by the integrated circuit due to its affordability, reduced size, capacity, and speed, autonomous vehicles have seen considerable progress with commercially viable options starting to emerge. (Masello et al., 2021).</p>
                    <p>Although the well-known brand ‘Tesla Motors’ are currently producing vehicles with significant levels of autonomy, they can only be classed currently as level 2 automation due to a higher level of scrutiny, but CEO Elon Musk claims that they will achieve level 4 by the end of 2022. (Fox, 2021). ‘Waymo’, owned by ‘Google’, have been carrying out a driverless taxi service in Arizona since 2020. This service is classed as level 4 autonomy with no driver present for the ride, however due to complexities with wet roads, American left turns, and the inability of these vehicles to operate in any unknown city, they are not yet capable of being classed as level 5 (Coppola and Bergen, 2021).</p>
                    <p>According to ABI research, by the year 2025 there will be 8 million consumer vehicles with SAE rating 3 or higher on the roads (ABi Research, 2018). Motor giant ‘Volkswagen’ are also targeting 2025 for the release of their commercial vehicle the ‘I.D. BUZZ’. It is set to offer an ‘SAE level 4’ driverless taxi service to selected cities across the world (Hanover, 2021).</p>
                    <p>LiDAR sensors are an integral part of the future of automated driving (Wang, 2021). LiDAR sensors send out a series of light beams that bounce of the surrounding environment, and when those light beams return to the sensor, they can use the elapsed time to work our distances travelled and therefore create a map of nearby objects. The main issue with them however is that their application in inclement weather such as rain or fog becomes inaccurate (Baker-Campbell, 2020). Overcoming this challenge will be essential for any manufacturers hoping to reach level 5 automation.</p>
                    <p>Another huge barrier for autonomous driving is ‘turning against traffic’ or the ‘unprotected left-hand turn’ (on American roads). Particularly in busy traffic conditions, autonomous driving systems are unable to correctly identify times to edge forward and cross safely over lanes of two-way traffic. ‘Waymo’ have been trying to combat this by using ‘TensorFlow Ecosystem’ to train its nets (Rangaiah, 2021) and by simulating the outcomes of ‘disengagement reports’ should the driver not have intervened (Verger R, 2019).</p>

                    <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
                    <p>The advancement of autonomous driving systems will have a large range of economic, social and environmental benefits, especially if SAE level 4 standard can be reached on a wide scale. Environmental benefits would be that the automated cars would be programmed to drive at the most economical rates but more importantly, if people begin sharing vehicles a smaller number of ADS vehicles could service the same population and needs as a much larger number of non-autonomous vehicles, with current estimates assuming that any one autonomous vehicle could replace 2.5 conventional vehicles (Othman, 2022). For example, after being driven to work, the passenger can send the vehicle back home to pick up the next household member for their commute. </p>
                    <p>Societal benefits include greater vehicle utilisation and reduced vehicle ownership, meaning less registration and maintenance, improved traffic conditions and better time utilisation, because commute time could be much more productive. Driverless cars could also provide great conditions for quarantined travel, a pertinent benefit given the recent pandemic. </p>
                    <p>Economic implications are that although many new jobs would be created in the development and management of autonomous driving systems and the structures that govern them, it might not outweigh the loss of driver jobs which it causes (Klaver F, 2020).</p>
                    <p>Governments could benefit by reducing costs of paroling police and paramedics, utilising driverless systems to transport non-urgent casualties or to allow humans to remain at the scene as an apprehended person is taken to a local police station. </p>

                    <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
                    <p>Our daily lives would be benefitted in numerous ways. Being able to share a single vehicle with partners, family or friends would reduce vehicle storage space on our properties (potentially even reducing building cost), allow multiple people to share the costs of maintenance, registration, and purchase price of vehicles. Taxi and delivery services would also become cheaper because the cost of human involvement would be removed.</p>
                    <p>The ability to utilise commute time for other activities would improve personal productivity to complete employment tasks or respond to personal emails etc. This would in turn increase ‘free time’ for recreational activities and time spent with friends and family or for working on personal projects. This could lead to improved personal wellbeing and productivity in employment. Taxi and delivery services would become cheaper because the cost of human involvement would be removed.</p>
                    <p>The reduced risk of crashes associated with autonomous driving systems would be a great benefit to any society that adopts them. Not only the immediate effect of being removed from the harm that could be caused, but the improved traffic conditions and reduction of hospitalisations would create room for other casualties. In unfortunate circumstances this could potentially save our lives (Pettigrew et al., 2018).</p>
                    <p>Autonomous driving systems would also remove the ability to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This would free up police time and allow us to feel that the services they provide are better serving us.</p>

                    <h3>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, and Other Small Computing Devices</h3>
                    <h5>Written by Jared Martin</h5>
                    <h4>What does it do? </h4>
                    <p>Raspberry Pi and Arduino are small computers on a board that enables people to design and create endless and unique creations. They are easily adaptable and mouldable with their uses with many small components such as cameras, voltage controllers, relays, water sensors, smoke sensors, IR (infer-red) controllers, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) card reader/Wrighter kits, and many more. These allow the computers to be adaptable to create endless machines.</p>
                    <h5>Arduino</h5>
                    <p>Arduino computers are simpler and cheaper than raspberry pi’s and come with more component options designed for them. Arduinos have very limited computing power but allow for easy small tasks. Their size allows them to be placed in small discrete locations where they can be used. A small project they can be used for is a LED strip light controller. Using an infer-red receiver, infer-red remote, power supply and LED strip lighting you can connect to an Arduino and code it to create patterns with the strip lighting as well as program the remote to adjust or change the LED strip lighting's function and colours. Although Arduino are powerful machines capable of much, they are not the most optimal for uses in commercial products due to their limitations. They are easy to replicate as the parts to use in Arduino are easily accessible though the ease of them being already assembled is what makes them such a popular and useful tool.Arduinos though somewhat complex machines have the capacity to become more powerful throughout the years they are limited from more powerful processors such as ARM as ARM is Patented.</p>
                    <h5>Raspberry pi</h5>
                    <p>Raspberry Pi’s are a much more advanced computer than the Arduino and come with more features included in them comparatively. They use ARM processors which are processors using the ARM architecture.  This architecture makes them some of the most advanced small computers.
                    Raspberry pi contain the power to do anything an Arduino can do and more. They can create small projects such as simple alarm systems, temperature controllers and LED controllers but these things are simple enough that they are generally made using Arduino. For the pi they are generally used to create or recreate complex and commercial products. One example of a popular use of the Raspberry pi is a portable simple game system. Using a raspberry pi and a SD (Standard Deviation) card they can be used to store and play on thousands of classic games that can be recreated or downloaded from the internet. Allowing people to play classics such as donkey Kong or Marrio to the classic mortal combat games. Another project is to use an old, outdated tv and bring it into the modern world by using the raspberry pi as a smart tv box. Bringing platforms such as Netflix and Stan to the loungeroom without buying a premade smart box from a cheap online store. Relating to the smart tv the raspberry pi is often used to make smart homes, allowing the user to turn off and on their accessories away from home or control them with less need for more components and hassle.</p>
                    <p>Given the effort most people can harness the power of the raspberry pi without much need-to-know coding or engineering skills. Many resources online include already created software and easy to follow guides for the most popular of its’ uses. The pi can be bought with components and project allowing anyone to be able to pick one up and learn to use it. Effectively making it not just a powerful machine but also, its own learning tool.</p>

                    <h5>What is the likely impact? </h5>
                    <p>The endless uses and power of the Raspberry pi have given it a staple name known largely throughout the computing and engineering world. Paired with Arduino they are both staples in today's world that will continue to grow. Arduino originated from 2005 with various improvements with new models introduced over the years. Raspberry pi was conceived less than a year later, and the first model being introduced in 2011 where it has seen many new models and improvements. One of the largest impacts of these both is their ability to be used and learnt by most allowing new generations to learn about technology in a fun and opportunistic manner, being able to create boundless project ideas. Much of the computer science-based world knows and uses these tools as fun side projects and learning tools. Their impact has reached youth and older users who interact with them and gain meaningful skills. Gaining the interest of many and helping many into a field that impacts their individual lives and for some the lives of others. The increasing development of these technologies will allow for more unique and powerful projects, encouraging more people to invest in tools that educate and elevate individuals into lifestyles and life decisions more passionate and rewarding. </p>

                    <h5>How will this affect you? </h5>
                    <p>More commonly people are beginning to learn about raspberry pi and Arduino as the world becomes more based around electronics and computer-based jobs. On a personal basis I have only learned about Arduinos and Raspberry pi recently over a year ago and I have interacted with many people who use them in their daily lives. Many owning multiple devices for many different projects. They shared their uses and capabilities. This inspired me to delve into electronic and computer-based studies.  For many of my friends that use them, they use them for simple automation such as an automatic door closer, and an ad-block server. These have proven to be useful and fun projects that were only possible due to the pi and Arduinos capabilities.Eventually I plan to buy myself some Arduino and Raspberry pi. I want to use them to improve my skills and gain new ones as the world of electronics spans vast areas. With them I will be able to create useful tools to make my life easier as well as projects such as a PS2 emulator using a raspberry pi emulator or an Arcade game console for small portable games.Using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi, I can introduce them using my projects to family and friends and hopefully inspire them to learn and create something using them as well. I could also use them as gifts by creating something unique and fun to give to someone for them to use and enjoy. The uses of them will allow me to not just purchase something but create something of my own design for others.</p>
                    <p>The Raspberry pi and Arduino are incredibly simple computers that allow people to create, learn, discover, and play with. Moulding lives and giving a base for many to explore their interests in technology. They are and will continue to be staple part of many lives with advancements that will give the ability for more complex and powerful uses.</p>
