            <p>Hi there, my name is Connor James Simpson, my RMIT student number is; s3965238. I come from a middling family, both mum and dad have worked in a variety of jobs, and I went to a public school. Made friends and lost friends and eventually found who my real mates were through trial and error! Education wise I have completed year 12 and done a Certificate II in Information and Technology. On top of that, if you can believe it, I am a college drop-out! My home language is English, though my folks, my sister and I all speak a little bit of everything, some days we will greet each other in a mix of English, German and French or ask for something in any number of other languages that we have investigated and studied enough to have some basic understanding of, what can I say, we all enjoy languages though we were all born in Australia. When it comes to down time, I enjoy gaming, whether its video games or tabletop RPG’s so long as I get to chat with some mates and celebrate good wins, I am a happy Chappy! </p>

            <p>Hi! I usually go by ‘Dom’, student number S3961464, I’m naturally hard-working and outgoing with a positive outlook. I can quickly build meaningful relationships and I gravitate towards people who are self-motivated. Should issues unfortunately arise, I believe in fully understanding the view of all involved by discussing them openly and honestly. I also believe that there is always a reasonable solution that can suit all parties in such instances. I enjoy walking in woodland with my wife and dogs, watching a variety of sports and movies, particularly fantasy or sci-fi, reading fantasy books and trying to keep up with current affairs. I am currently studying toward a Bachelor of Commerce in my spare time, being one year into the six-year, part time degree, I have a long way to go but am enjoying the learning experience. My wife and I are also excitedly expecting our first child on the break of the coming new year, so we are spending lots of time planning for them!</p>

            <p>My name is Jared I am an aspiring IT (Information Technology) student of RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). I am starting my journey again into the world of education after the 2 years of break from the schooling system to set myself up for the future ahead (as well as the hindrance of covid). I moved away from my hometown after graduating year 12 to re-evaluate myself and what I wanted to do for the future. Using the extra free time, I had I began to pick up hobbies and interests I was not able to do from my old home. I went out to buy my first skateboard being unsure if I was going to be interested and invested enough to learn. The first few days were like learning to walk again with my balance completely off for every new movement I tried. Although I still feel like a novice to the sport and have much to learn, it has become the most peaceful, calming, and fun activities that I am dedicated to mastering. Skateboarding allowed me to strengthen my physical abilities, clear my mind when needed, as well as understanding how to express myself internally and externally. Using my love for skateboard art and the board itself to express myself within the sport by using the skills I had learned and the art I use to convey my love for the sport and emotions. </p>

                    <div id="profile-analysis">
                        <p>As our team has completed a wide range of personality tests, this analysis will focus on the Myers-Briggs test results for each individual member.  Within the Myer’s Briggs test there are four foundational personality groups: Analysts, Diplomats, Sentinels, and Explorers (Personality Types, 2022). As a team, the Awesome Breakfast Club is quite diverse, covering three of the four personality groups with Trent in the Explorer group, Connor and Jared as Diplomats, and Dominic and Annesha in the Sentinels group. </p>
                        <p>This diversity in personality types means that as a group we have a variation of different attitudes, opinions and perspectives. In terms of communication, we have 60% Introverts and 40% Extroverts. With this mixture of introverts and extroverts, we will need to consciously make our meetings a safe space in which both introverts and extroverts have the space and time to express their thoughts with the group, so they do not go unheard. In practice this can mean proactively running our meeting with an agenda so that all members can come to the meeting prepared for discussion, and then within the meetings, ensuring that every member has a chance to voice their thoughts on the agenda items prior to proceeding with the next topics. As the team contains introverts, it’s important that we utilise these methodologies in practice encourage equal expression and involvement. </p>
                        <p>Within the Myer-Briggs test results, the third and fourth letters letter of a personality type indicate a person’s decision-making techniques and their perception of their surroundings (Myers-Briggs personality type and conflict - what causes fights between MBTI types?, 2021). In analysing the personality types, both traits combined provide insight as to how individuals view and react to conflict. Of the four possible combinations for these pairs, the ABC team has three of the four combinations. The majority of the team have the traits Feeling and Judging (Annesha, Dominic and Jared), whilst Connor is Feeling and Perceiving, and Trent is Thinking and Perceiving.</p>
                        <p>To summarise the different traits, Annesha, Dominic and Jared are likely to have conflict arise when their core beliefs are challenged, and will approach it in an extraverted way, discussing and resolving the conflict verbally (Myers-Briggs personality type and conflict - what causes fights between MBTI types?, 2021). As a Feeling and Perceiving type, Connor is likely to face conflict for the same reasons, however, is more likely to feel this conflict internally. Whist Trent is also likely to experience conflict internally, this conflict alternatively arises when trust and credibility are challenged (Myers-Briggs personality type and conflict - what causes fights between MBTI types?, 2021). In practice, the group can attempt to reduce conflict by being aware of the potential triggers for each member. For the FJ and FP types, one of the most important values is maintaining positive relationships and making sure all members feel heard. For the TP members of the group, it is important that trust is maintained and everyone’s credibility within the group is respected. By respecting each member’s values, the team will be able to uphold a strong level of productivity, reducing conflict and unease withing the team.  In respecting each other’s values, beliefs and integrity, the team also creates a safe environment which encourages both creativity and cohesion.</p>

                <h4> What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? </h4> 
                <p>Annesha: Technical Business Analyst  </p>  
                <p>Connor: Cybersecurity Analyst </p>
                <p>Dominic: Financial accountant  </p>
                <p>Jared: Cyber Analysist </p>
                <p>Trent: Security Development</p>

                <h4>How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? </h4>
                <p>Cyber security roles such as those chosen by Connor, Jared and Trent are currently in high demand with Australia being short 25,000 skilled or qualified people to fulfill the industries workforce as of November 2021. (Braue, 2021). This demand gap will likely continue as the ‘Australian Skills Commission’ expects an enormous 38.9% future growth in the field, (Australian Government Labour Market Insights, 2021) with Australians set to spend between $5.6 - $7.6 billion in 2022 (AustCyber, 2021).</p>
                <p>Annesha’s chosen role as Business Analyst looks to have a safe future with seek adverts for similar roles increasing by 8.6% in 2019 (iRM Training, 2019). This was before 90% of Australian businesses reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic by instating new technologies to survive, furthering the need for business analysists. (UTS Online, 2022).</p>
                <p>Current projections from the ‘Australian Skills Commission’ expect to see a further 12.9% growth in this field between now and 2024. (Australian Government Labour Market Insights, 2021).The outlook for Dominic is not quite as positive because although the accounting industry is set to have an increased demand for work of 9.2% between now and 2026 (Australian Government Labour Market Insights, 2021), there is set to be high competition in the field putting downward pressure on salaries and job opportunities. (IBIS World, 2021). However, if Dominic looks to specialise in taxation or audit style accounting, there would be a greater demand for work and potentially less downward pressure on wages (You unlimited, 2021).</p>

                <h4>The Group’s Required Skill Set:</h4>
                <table></table>
                <p>(Glenn N, 2022), (Australian Government Labour Market Insights, 2021), (Australian Army, 2022), (simplilearn, 2022) , (Australian Government Labour Market Insights, 2021), (Half R, 2022), (Australian Government Labour Market Insights, 2021).</p>   

                <h4>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
                <p>In the jobs relating to cybersecurity employers are demanding that employees maintain a strong knowledge of security trends, new technologies and new risks as the field is developing so rapidly. They also hold knowledge and application of security standards, such as the ISO27000 series in high regard alongside professional certifications in the field. (Beckley R, 2021). These demands aren’t a direct reflection of the industry required skills perse, however qualifications and knowledge of industry standards would heavily imply that the technical skills we have listed above would be present in the applicant. The technical skills listed such as knowledge of operating systems (e.g. Linux) and a wide range of coding knowledge are also highly regarded by employers. (Dice, 2022).</p>
                <p>Business analyst employers have a high demand for computer literacy with a wide array of tools, such as SQL, Excel and ‘power BI’. (indeed, 2022). Another skill required by many employers is process modelling. This visual interpretation of business systems and their practical uses is extremely useful in communicating ideas to management and the teams utilising them. (IBM Cloud Education, 2021).</p>
                <p>In accounting there has been an increase a 33% in demand for ‘Python’ programming skills in 2021 which was surprising (Williamson R, 2021).  This contradicts our table of required IT skills which focussed more on the use of industry tools. Other IT skills including knowledge of Applications & Products Data Processing, Enterprise Resource Planning, Structured Query Language and Scrum have become in huge demand since the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased businesses need to go digital. (Williamson R, 2021)</p>

                <h4>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h4>
                <p>Employers of Cyber Security analysts and developers state high demand for communication skills such as active listening, attention to detail and problem-solving skills (Krakoff S, 2022). These skills are a very good reflection of the general skills which we identified in the table above. Communication seems to be one of the most desired skills, to enable clear communication of complex ideas, especially to customers. (Dice, 2022).</p>
                <p>For Business analysts, employers have highest demand for analytical decision making with 69.49% of job adverts in the field stating this as a desirable skill. Other high-ranking skills included teamwork (listed on 63.48% of industry job adverts) and communication (listed on 60.78% of industry job adverts) (Verma et al., 2021).</p>
                <p>The general skills, or soft skills, most highly regarded by employers are accounting organisational skills such as task prioritisation and accuracy, written and verbal communication and continual learning. (Ottawa University, 2021). These skills closely matched those identified in our required skill set. Another greatly demanded skill is ethical commitment due the deservedly scrutinised nature of the work. (Boyd K, 2021).</p>

                <h4>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? </h4>
                <p>Annesha: in 2021, three of the most required Business Analyst IT skills outside the standard business analyst skillset included Statistical analysis software, Database Querying languages, and Surveying/query software (Iacolino, 2021).</p>
                <p> Connor: For the Cyber Security Analyst role the three highest ranked IT Specific skills are; 1: Programming, 2: Extensive Coding Knowledge, 3: Knowledge of VPN’s and Firewalls. Based on the data above.</p>
                <p> Dominic: In accounting, the three highest ranked IT specific skills which are not listed in our required set are:</p>

                <h4>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h4>
                <p>Annesha: After reviewing the Burning Glass data on the role of Technical Business Analyst, my opinion of my Ideal job has not changed, in fact it has been further confirmed. Personally, I find that the general skills required for the role suit my skill, particularly critical thinking, and analytical and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the IT skills mentioned which I have not already obtained are of great interest to me, particularly programming. </p>
                <p>Connor: Even after looking at the Burning Glass data my opinion stays unchanged... though my outlook might be considered cynical I don’t really have an “Ideal Job” no job I’ve looked at in the past, including this one, has been able to even remotely fit all the niches I’d like to have in something I would consider ideal as a job. A job is a job, so long as I learn the skills necessary to do the job well or, even better, excel at the position I’m in within that job's boundaries then I’m happy enough to utilise it for what it does for me at the end of the day; which is simply earn me a wage I can, at the very least, live on.</p>
                <p>Dom: Although my general opinion about my ideal job has not changed, the burning glass data has made me consider that I might need to specialise in a less competitive area of the industry since the slow growth rate is being outpaced by the available workforce. If I don’t look to specialise I could struggle to find work, or find myself receiving low pay. Other than this, I think the burning glass data has reaffirmed that my skillset is well suited to my ideal job and I still look forward to working in the industry when I complete my studies. </p>

                <h2>IT Work</h2> 
                <p>Chris Scott, Systems Administrator of a local high school, was kind enough to agree to an interview with me. Unfortunately, due to him contracting covid and having a sore throat he wasn’t able to conduct the interview over video, so we conversed via email instead.  </p>  
                <p>I was meeting with Chris to find out about his experience as an IT professional and hoped to get a deeper understanding of the field, along with any insights he had to be successful within it. I first sought to find out how long Chris had been working as an IT professional. He noted that he had been working full-time for approximately 10 years but had been working part-time for businesses during his final 3 years of high school. Intrigued as to what types of work would be compatible with school hours I posed the question, ‘What kind of work were you doing toward the end of high school? Was it a substantial amount of work?’. Chris answered, ‘Towards the end of school, I was doing quite a few shop fit outs for franchises that were opening stores and then provided them with ongoing support.’ </p> 
                <p>Having established a base for Chris’ experience working as a professional, I wanted to understand how he broke into the field. He surprised me by saying that initially he was totally self-taught and just following his passion for the field. He applied for holiday work at his school which led to full-time job following his completion of high school. Once he was comfortable in his position, he enrolled in a Bachelor of Science (Cyber Security), studying online so he could continue his full-time employment. Although Chris had already gained full-time employment in his chosen field, he still says that ‘If I was to do it again, I’d start university right away’, with the key takeaways from his study being communication and time management skills ‘aside from the actual course content’. So, we had covered the experience and qualifications and now it was into the nitty gritty. Chris told me that his day-to-day job lists included ‘patching software and systems, backup management, log reviewing, application deployment, network changes, network monitoring and end-user support’ with occasional work ‘developing project proposals and deployment of new systems and technology throughout the College’. Most of Chris’ time, however, is spent on ‘Research and documentation’ as well as ‘reviewing the latest patches or software, testing and then deploying’.     
                </p>
                <p>On a weekly basis, Chris doesn’t have significant communication with other IT professionals, in fact the majority of his regular contacts are ‘end-users, management, the helpdesk, and vendors’. He mentioned that he is part of an online group for IT professionals within the local school system, however it does not prompt regular discussion and Chris reflected on the matter stating, ‘I don’t know if this is a school IT issue, a location issue or something of the wider IT profession’.</p>
                <p>I asked Chris if he was spending an increasing amount of time working remotely due to advances in the field, but he says that, although he can perform some aspects of the job from home and this allows him to focus efforts without distraction, most of his working time is spent in the office because ‘for some things, it is easier to be in the office’. </p>
                <p>For the final part of our interview, I gathered some great insights into the challenges and rewards of the professional IT world. Chris told me that other than budget approval, the greatest difficulty he faces in his position is ‘Keeping up to date with the latest technology trends’. Chris says his primary sources for overcoming this are ‘vendors or value-added resellers (vars)’. Chris also says that research is vital whether it be via online blog or conferences which are held consistently. This need for education and research backs up Chris’ personal insight into the IT industry, ‘You can’t stagnate and stop learning otherwise you’ll be left behind’. </p>
                <p>To highlight the rewards and great benefits of the IT industry, Chris shared with me a project that he had developed which captured the essence of the industry as a whole. ‘I digitized our purchase order books into an automated system that gets approval from multiple people. It saves multiple peoples time, leaves an audit trail and stops us buying paper purchase order books’. Innovative developments like this offer economic and environmentally friendly solutions to old and laborious problems, that when implemented across businesses can have an enormous impact on our lives. So, with our interview concluded I am going to wrap it up and take Chris’ sound advice ‘Always have tested offline backups’! </p>

                    <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
                    <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
                    <h5>Written by Dominic Gee</h5>
                    <p>Autonomous vehicles or Automated driving systems (ADS) are driving systems that require varying levels of human intervention to propel and navigate themselves in a safe manner along pre-determined routes (Wikipedia, 2022). The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has categorized autonomous driving into six different levels ranging from 0 – 5.</p>
                    
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Level 0</th>
                            <td>No driving automation</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Level 1</th>
                            <td>Assisted driving – in certain circumstances the vehicle can control steering or speed to assist the driver.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Level 2</th>
                            <td>Partial automation – in a wider field of certain circumstances the vehicle can control steering or speed to assist the driver.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Level 3</th>
                            <td>Conditional Automation – In normal conditions the vehicle controls steering and speed, but drivers are required to always maintain supervision. </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Level 4</th>
                            <td>High automation – In normal conditions the vehicle can completely control the vehicle without driver supervision. </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Level 5</th>
                            <td>Full autonomy - In any condition the vehicle can completely control the vehicle without driver supervision.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>(SAE international, 2021). </p>

                    <p>The first prototypes of autonomous driving systems were unveiled in the early 1920’s but were closer to remote controlled than autonomous. (Kroger, 2016). In recent years, catalyzed by the integrated circuit due to its affordability, reduced size, capacity, and speed, autonomous vehicles have seen considerable progress with commercially viable options starting to emerge. (Masello et al., 2021).</p>
                    <p>Although the well-known brand ‘Tesla Motors’ are currently producing vehicles with significant levels of autonomy, they can only be classed currently as level 2 automation due to a higher level of scrutiny, but CEO Elon Musk claims that they will achieve level 4 by the end of 2022. (Fox, 2021). ‘Waymo’, owned by ‘Google’, have been carrying out a driverless taxi service in Arizona since 2020. This service is classed as level 4 autonomy with no driver present for the ride, however due to complexities with wet roads, American left turns, and the inability of these vehicles to operate in any unknown city, they are not yet capable of being classed as level 5 (Coppola and Bergen, 2021).</p>
                    <p>According to ABI research, by the year 2025 there will be 8 million consumer vehicles with SAE rating 3 or higher on the roads (ABi Research, 2018). Motor giant ‘Volkswagen’ are also targeting 2025 for the release of their commercial vehicle the ‘I.D. BUZZ’. It is set to offer an ‘SAE level 4’ driverless taxi service to selected cities across the world (Hanover, 2021).</p>
                    <p>LiDAR sensors are an integral part of the future of automated driving (Wang, 2021). LiDAR sensors send out a series of light beams that bounce of the surrounding environment, and when those light beams return to the sensor, they can use the elapsed time to work our distances travelled and therefore create a map of nearby objects. The main issue with them however is that their application in inclement weather such as rain or fog becomes inaccurate (Baker-Campbell, 2020). Overcoming this challenge will be essential for any manufacturers hoping to reach level 5 automation.</p>
                    <p>Another huge barrier for autonomous driving is ‘turning against traffic’ or the ‘unprotected left-hand turn’ (on American roads). Particularly in busy traffic conditions, autonomous driving systems are unable to correctly identify times to edge forward and cross safely over lanes of two-way traffic. ‘Waymo’ have been trying to combat this by using ‘TensorFlow Ecosystem’ to train its nets (Rangaiah, 2021) and by simulating the outcomes of ‘disengagement reports’ should the driver not have intervened (Verger R, 2019).</p>

                    <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
                    <p>The advancement of autonomous driving systems will have a large range of economic, social and environmental benefits, especially if SAE level 4 standard can be reached on a wide scale. Environmental benefits would be that the automated cars would be programmed to drive at the most economical rates but more importantly, if people begin sharing vehicles a smaller number of ADS vehicles could service the same population and needs as a much larger number of non-autonomous vehicles, with current estimates assuming that any one autonomous vehicle could replace 2.5 conventional vehicles (Othman, 2022). For example, after being driven to work, the passenger can send the vehicle back home to pick up the next household member for their commute. </p>
                    <p>Societal benefits include greater vehicle utilisation and reduced vehicle ownership, meaning less registration and maintenance, improved traffic conditions and better time utilisation, because commute time could be much more productive. Driverless cars could also provide great conditions for quarantined travel, a pertinent benefit given the recent pandemic. </p>
                    <p>Economic implications are that although many new jobs would be created in the development and management of autonomous driving systems and the structures that govern them, it might not outweigh the loss of driver jobs which it causes (Klaver F, 2020).</p>
                    <p>Governments could benefit by reducing costs of paroling police and paramedics, utilising driverless systems to transport non-urgent casualties or to allow humans to remain at the scene as an apprehended person is taken to a local police station. </p>

                    <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
                    <p>Our daily lives would be benefitted in numerous ways. Being able to share a single vehicle with partners, family or friends would reduce vehicle storage space on our properties (potentially even reducing building cost), allow multiple people to share the costs of maintenance, registration, and purchase price of vehicles. Taxi and delivery services would also become cheaper because the cost of human involvement would be removed.</p>
                    <p>The ability to utilise commute time for other activities would improve personal productivity to complete employment tasks or respond to personal emails etc. This would in turn increase ‘free time’ for recreational activities and time spent with friends and family or for working on personal projects. This could lead to improved personal wellbeing and productivity in employment. Taxi and delivery services would become cheaper because the cost of human involvement would be removed.</p>
                    <p>The reduced risk of crashes associated with autonomous driving systems would be a great benefit to any society that adopts them. Not only the immediate effect of being removed from the harm that could be caused, but the improved traffic conditions and reduction of hospitalisations would create room for other casualties. In unfortunate circumstances this could potentially save our lives (Pettigrew et al., 2018).</p>
                    <p>Autonomous driving systems would also remove the ability to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This would free up police time and allow us to feel that the services they provide are better serving us.</p>

                    <h3>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, and Other Small Computing Devices</h3>
                    <h5>Written by Jared Martin</h5>
                    <h4>What does it do? </h4>
                    <p>Raspberry Pi and Arduino are small computers on a board that enables people to design and create endless and unique creations. They are easily adaptable and mouldable with their uses with many small components such as cameras, voltage controllers, relays, water sensors, smoke sensors, IR (infer-red) controllers, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) card reader/Wrighter kits, and many more. These allow the computers to be adaptable to create endless machines.</p>
                    <h5>Arduino</h5>
                    <p>Arduino computers are simpler and cheaper than raspberry pi’s and come with more component options designed for them. Arduinos have very limited computing power but allow for easy small tasks. Their size allows them to be placed in small discrete locations where they can be used. A small project they can be used for is a LED strip light controller. Using an infer-red receiver, infer-red remote, power supply and LED strip lighting you can connect to an Arduino and code it to create patterns with the strip lighting as well as program the remote to adjust or change the LED strip lighting's function and colours. Although Arduino are powerful machines capable of much, they are not the most optimal for uses in commercial products due to their limitations. They are easy to replicate as the parts to use in Arduino are easily accessible though the ease of them being already assembled is what makes them such a popular and useful tool.Arduinos though somewhat complex machines have the capacity to become more powerful throughout the years they are limited from more powerful processors such as ARM as ARM is Patented.</p>
                    <h5>Raspberry pi</h5>
                    <p>Raspberry Pi’s are a much more advanced computer than the Arduino and come with more features included in them comparatively. They use ARM processors which are processors using the ARM architecture.  This architecture makes them some of the most advanced small computers.
                    Raspberry pi contain the power to do anything an Arduino can do and more. They can create small projects such as simple alarm systems, temperature controllers and LED controllers but these things are simple enough that they are generally made using Arduino. For the pi they are generally used to create or recreate complex and commercial products. One example of a popular use of the Raspberry pi is a portable simple game system. Using a raspberry pi and a SD (Standard Deviation) card they can be used to store and play on thousands of classic games that can be recreated or downloaded from the internet. Allowing people to play classics such as donkey Kong or Marrio to the classic mortal combat games. Another project is to use an old, outdated tv and bring it into the modern world by using the raspberry pi as a smart tv box. Bringing platforms such as Netflix and Stan to the loungeroom without buying a premade smart box from a cheap online store. Relating to the smart tv the raspberry pi is often used to make smart homes, allowing the user to turn off and on their accessories away from home or control them with less need for more components and hassle.</p>
                    <p>Given the effort most people can harness the power of the raspberry pi without much need-to-know coding or engineering skills. Many resources online include already created software and easy to follow guides for the most popular of its’ uses. The pi can be bought with components and project allowing anyone to be able to pick one up and learn to use it. Effectively making it not just a powerful machine but also, its own learning tool.</p>

                    <h5>What is the likely impact? </h5>
                    <p>The endless uses and power of the Raspberry pi have given it a staple name known largely throughout the computing and engineering world. Paired with Arduino they are both staples in today's world that will continue to grow. Arduino originated from 2005 with various improvements with new models introduced over the years. Raspberry pi was conceived less than a year later, and the first model being introduced in 2011 where it has seen many new models and improvements. One of the largest impacts of these both is their ability to be used and learnt by most allowing new generations to learn about technology in a fun and opportunistic manner, being able to create boundless project ideas. Much of the computer science-based world knows and uses these tools as fun side projects and learning tools. Their impact has reached youth and older users who interact with them and gain meaningful skills. Gaining the interest of many and helping many into a field that impacts their individual lives and for some the lives of others. The increasing development of these technologies will allow for more unique and powerful projects, encouraging more people to invest in tools that educate and elevate individuals into lifestyles and life decisions more passionate and rewarding. </p>

                    <h5>How will this affect you? </h5>
                    <p>More commonly people are beginning to learn about raspberry pi and Arduino as the world becomes more based around electronics and computer-based jobs. On a personal basis I have only learned about Arduinos and Raspberry pi recently over a year ago and I have interacted with many people who use them in their daily lives. Many owning multiple devices for many different projects. They shared their uses and capabilities. This inspired me to delve into electronic and computer-based studies.  For many of my friends that use them, they use them for simple automation such as an automatic door closer, and an ad-block server. These have proven to be useful and fun projects that were only possible due to the pi and Arduinos capabilities.Eventually I plan to buy myself some Arduino and Raspberry pi. I want to use them to improve my skills and gain new ones as the world of electronics spans vast areas. With them I will be able to create useful tools to make my life easier as well as projects such as a PS2 emulator using a raspberry pi emulator or an Arcade game console for small portable games.Using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi, I can introduce them using my projects to family and friends and hopefully inspire them to learn and create something using them as well. I could also use them as gifts by creating something unique and fun to give to someone for them to use and enjoy. The uses of them will allow me to not just purchase something but create something of my own design for others.</p>
                    <p>The Raspberry pi and Arduino are incredibly simple computers that allow people to create, learn, discover, and play with. Moulding lives and giving a base for many to explore their interests in technology. They are and will continue to be staple part of many lives with advancements that will give the ability for more complex and powerful uses.</p>

                    <h3>Clouds, Services, Servers</h3>
                    <h5>Written by Annesha Sharp</h5>
                    <p>The term Cloud Computing encapsulates a wide range of virtual computing services delivered over the internet, commonly referred to as the Cloud. Cloud Computing Services includes four different types of services; Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Serverless computing (What Is Cloud Computing? A Beginner’s Guide, 2022). As the name suggests, IaaS offers users the ability to rent IT infrastructure, including Virtual machines and Servers, on a pay as you go subscription. The primary benefit of using IaaS is the reduced cost for usage, and the regular maintenance cost for the infrastructure by incurred by the service provider, rather than the user. PaaS is a cloud development environment which facilitate the web and application development. In addition to the infrastructure supplied in IaaS, PaaS also includes resources such as development tools and database management systems to assist in development (What is PaaS? Platform as a Service, 2022). SaaS adds an additional element of support on top of PaaS, by also providing web hosting services for the application, allowing customers to access the cloud application in a web browser, a popular example of SaaS is Salesforce (SaaS: Software as a Service, 2022). With pay-as-you go service, Serverless Computing is designed for developers, to reduce the server management tasks and costs associated with software development. Rather than reserving and paying for the maximum number of servers the project may require, the server usage is managed by the provider to allocate servers as needed (What is serverless computing? | Serverless definition, 2022).</p>
                    <p>State-of-the-art Cloud computing technologies can be seen in the data centres of the three leaders within the industry: AWS, Microsoft, and Google (Gartner, 2021). As per the Gartner Report for 2021, All three of these companies have geographically diverse datacentres located across the globe, upgrade technologies to improve performance and efficiency, and provide a wide range of growing services. </p>
                    <p>In the coming years, the widespread adoption of cloud computing is expected to continue to grow as it has over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Gartner, the world-wide annual expenditure on public cloud services is expected to increase from 410 billion dollars in 2021, to $494.7 billion dollars in 2022, and then almost 600 billion dollars in 2023 (Gartner Forecasts Worldwide Public Cloud End-User Spending to Reach Nearly $500 Billion in 2022, 2022). Whilst this growth has been widespread across all areas of Cloud Computing Services, four new trends in Cloud Computing came to light in late 2021 and are expected to be the future of the service, these four trends include Cloud Ubiquity, Regional Cloud Ecosystems, Cloud Sustainability, and Automated programmable Infrastructure (Gartner Says Four Trends Are Shaping the Future of Public Cloud, 2022).</p>
                    <p>The term Cloud Ubiquity is related to the concept of Ubiquitous Computing, where computational services are available and any time or place across a wide range of devices (What is Ubiquitous Computing? | Security Encyclopedia, 2022). Ubiquitous Computing is a very broad term, referring to various aspects of IT including Communication, Entertainment and Smart home integrations etc. (Vahdat-Nejad, Eilaki and Izadpanah, 2018). Through increased adoption and availability of Cloud Computing, Cloud Ubiquity will support the adoption and growth of Ubiquitous Computing, by providing the services required. </p>
                    <p>The Regional Cloud Ecosystems trend predicts that in the coming years Data Centres will become more prevalent in different regions to support local demand (Cummings and Was, 2021). For many years Cloud Services have utilised overseas data centres to fulfil the work, however this has presented issues due to varying data laws and regulations in different countries.</p>
                    <p>In Cloud Computing, there are two primary environmental risks; Carbon Dioxide emissions resulting from Data Centre energy consumption, and the water consumption required to cool the servers in Data Centres. In theory, the use of Cloud Computing services is likely to reduce energy usage, by optimising resource consumption using virtual machines (Trivedi and Sharma, 2014). However, in practice these Data Centres need to be managed rigorously to ensure server virtualisation and consolidation are used properly to effectively minimise the Centre’s energy usage. In 2016, the US Department of Energy provided two Improved management solutions to minimise the footprint of data centres. The first option ‘Improved Power Usage Effectiveness’, encourages a reduction in the infrastructure energy consumption used by smaller data centres, through environmentally friendly means such as improving airflow within the facility. The second recommendation is to remove inactive servers, which at the time were estimated to be 10-30% of Data centre servers in the US. At the time of this report, these two changes were estimated to reduce data centre energy usage in the united states by 10% (Shehabi et al., 2016).</p>
                    <p>Automated Programmable Infrastructure refers to cloud services which utilise Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine learning for infrastructure management. In the long-term, adopting the Artificial Intelligence and machine learning managed infrastructure will greatly reduce the operational costs associated with system administration and maintenance (Gartner Says Four Trends Are Shaping the Future of Public Cloud, 2022).</p>
                    <h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>
                    <p>Resulting from the widespread adoption of Cloud Computing, Cloud Ubiquity will result in more diverse usage of cloud services, to support a wider range of devices. Given the broad nature of Cloud Ubiquity, it is expected that generally this trend will further advance telecommunication and automation technologies, further growing the user’s ability to access technology “in an anywhere/anytime manner” (Vahdat-Nejad, Eilaki and Izadpanah, 2018). By increasing the accessibility of technology, this trend will also support further remote working capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Regional Cloud Ecosystems will likely reduce the risks associated with using Cloud Services, as more Data Centres will be accessible in each country. When using international cloud services, companies can risk losing data or facing legal difficulties as regulations may be different in the hosting country. Regional Cloud Ecosystems will reduce this risk by having Data Centres available in the country of use and aligned with the local region’s regulations (Cummings and Was, 2021). Ideally the future change to Regional Cloud Ecosystems should see an increase in data centre jobs available in each country. </p>
                    <p>In 2016, it was estimated that Data Centres were responsible for almost 2% of the United State’s electricity consumption (Francis, 2021). In recent years the components required by data centres have become more efficient in their power usage, however with the widespread adoption of this technology, extra efforts will be required from corporations to ensure Cloud computing does not contribute further to the current climate crisis.  In the future, these efforts are expected to result in further transparency around the carbon footprint of Cloud Services Users. Additionally, this has resulted in many Data Centres, such as NEXTDC, offering Carbon neutral options for their customers, and in the long-term switching to renewable energy sources. (Carbon Neutral Solutions | NEXTneutral, 2022). Google has also demonstrated revolutionary progress with their Carbon-Intelligent Computing project, which redirects cloud computing task to data centres where renewable energy is available, reducing the production of carbon emissions wherever possible (Koningstein, 2021).</p>
                    <p>In the coming years Automated Programmable Infrastructure usage is expected to grow in Cloud Services. From a corporate perspective, this will reduce operational costs greatly and reduce the workload of Server Administrators, however from an individual perspective this could possibly result in job loss within the IT industry. </p>

                    <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
                    <p>Working as a Software Tester, the widespread adoption of cloud services has presented many benefits, resulting in more flexible work options and an increase in software development resources using PaaS. The impacts of Data Centre’s on the climate crisis presents as a concerning issue, and I am hopeful that the ecological impacts of the technology will be minimised, so it benefits both Technological Advancement and the Climate. The possible job losses that could result from the introduction of Automated Programmable Infrastructure could likely have negative impacts within the IT workforce. Personally, this predicted change highlights the importance of upskilling and staying up to date with new technologies. This point is particularly relevant for me, as I am currently undertaking professional development training in Automated testing, which will likely be the future of Software testing in Cloud Computing.</p>
